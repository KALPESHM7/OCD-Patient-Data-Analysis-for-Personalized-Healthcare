Title: “OCD-Patient-Data-Analysis-for-Personalized-Healthcare”

Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze OCD patient data to uncover trends, group patients based on symptom severity, and predict medication effectiveness. 
The insights aim to optimize treatment strategies and improve healthcare outcomes.

Data Cleaning
Missing values in categorical columns (Previous Diagnoses, Medications) were replaced with "Not Reported".

Outliers in numerical columns (e.g., Age) were removed using IQR and Isolation Forest techniques.

Duplicate records were identified and removed for data consistency.

EDA Insights
Demographics:

Most patients are aged 25–65, with a slight majority being female (60%).

Diagnoses peaked in 2018, possibly due to increased awareness campaigns.

Symptom Severity:

Obsession and compulsion scores are strongly correlated (
r=0.78
r=0.78).

Patients on SSRIs show lower average obsession scores compared to Benzodiazepines.

Feature Engineering
Numerical features (Age, Y-BOCS Scores) were scaled using StandardScaler for better model performance.

Categorical features (Gender, Medications) were encoded using one-hot encoding.

A new feature, Symptom_Duration_Per_Year, was created to represent symptom duration in years.

Model Building
Clustering (K-Means):

Patients were grouped into 3 clusters:

Cluster 0: Younger patients with mild symptoms.

Cluster 1: Middle-aged patients with moderate symptoms.

Cluster 2: Older patients with severe symptoms.

Classification (Logistic Regression):

The model predicts SSRI effectiveness with an accuracy of 84%.
