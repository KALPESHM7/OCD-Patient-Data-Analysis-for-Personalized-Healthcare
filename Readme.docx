OCD Patient Data Analysis for Personalized Healthcare

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing OCD patient data to uncover trends, group patients based on symptom severity, and predict medication effectiveness using machine learning techniques.
 The goal is to provide actionable insights that drive personalized healthcare strategies.

Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze patient demographics, symptoms, and treatment data.
- Group patients into clusters based on symptom severity using clustering techniques.
- Predict the effectiveness of medications like SSRIs using classification models.

Steps Involved
 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values by replacing them with "Not Reported".
- Removed outliers using IQR and Isolation Forest techniques.
- Eliminated duplicate records for consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized demographic distributions (e.g., age, gender).
- Identified correlations between obsession and compulsion scores.
- Analyzed trends in diagnoses over time.

3. Feature Engineering
- Scaled numerical features (`Age`, `Y-BOCS Scores`) using StandardScaler.
- Encoded categorical features (`Gender`, `Medications`) via one-hot encoding.
- Created a new feature: `Symptom_Duration_Per_Year`.

4. Model Building
Clustering:
- Applied K-Means clustering to group patients into clusters based on symptoms and demographics.

Classification:
- Built a Logistic Regression model to predict medication effectiveness (e.g., SSRIs).

Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
